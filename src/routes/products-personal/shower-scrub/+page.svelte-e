          p I have used bamboo snow for two full years: I have personally verified that bamboo snow is compatible with skin. Every part. Yes, that too.
          p Bamboo Snow mixes with liquid shower soap to make a very effective face and body scrub. It cleans away dead skin with ease and rinses thoroughly.
          p Conditioning skin oils can be mixed in as well.
          p Bamboo Snow helps the soap mobilize and remove dirt, grime and dead skin. It actally is a soap magnifier, because it is applied directly to the surface, rather than diluted in water.
          p Bamboo Snow absorbs the grime inside each particle, and rinses away most easily.
          p You will be impressed.
