          p Bamboo Snow is a new resource. Itâ€™s attributes are numerous, but unknown and untested by the world. The exact market value of Bamboo Snow will be based on trust, quality and performance.

          p My goal is not to make a business out of selling Bamboo Snow, or really having any business at all. My goal is to help people around the world use Bamboo Snow and enjoy the benefits to themselves and the people who supply it.
