This is on my **Must Have** List for daily use!

I have used bamboo snow for two full years:  I have personally verified that bamboo snow is compatible with skin.  Every part.  Yes, that too.

Bamboo Snow mixes with liquid shower soap to make a very effective face and body scrub.  It cleans away dead skin with ease and rinses thoroughly.

Conditioning skin oils can be mixed in as well.

Bamboo Snow helps the soap mobilize and remove dirt, grime and dead skin.  It actally is a soap magnifier, because it is applied directly to the surface, rather than diluted in water.

Bamboo Snow absorbs the grime inside each particle, and rinses away most easily.

You will be impressed.
