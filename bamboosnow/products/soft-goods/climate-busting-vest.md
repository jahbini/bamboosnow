Bamboo Snow also breathes --- it will absorb the sweat from your body and keep you and your clothes dry when the humidity rises.

A vest made with a one quarter to one half inch of bamboo snow filling absorbs sweat far better than cotton.

Bamboo Snow is an excellent thermal insulator, and keeps you warm in the cold, and cool in the heat.

The vest was tested by several island residents, including two athletes who used it during training: all confirmed the utility of the vest.

#Use and Care
This vest is reversable one side reflects heat back to the body, and the other is better at absorbing the heat.  I use it under my shirt to get maximum performance.

When I'm not wearing it I let it air in the open, and never put it in a closed container.  
It the surface gets soiled, I just mix a bit of cleaner with bamboo snow, and use a brush to clean.  Washing in the laundry is **not** recommended.

## Production Notes
alert@@This prototype vest allows the bamboo snow to move, and collect at the bottom.  
An effective vest design must have means to keep bamboo snow immobile.

alert@@The cut of the prototype was modeled after wedding attire.  A simpler cut with the bamboo snow placed appropriately is needed.

The cloth for the prototype has a very fine weave and is effective to keep the bamboo snow inside the vest.
