Bamboo Snow conquers slippery spills in seconds.
<!-- excerpt -->
Raw, dry bamboo snow will suck up oil, grease or water from a floor in a moment.  A slippery floor can be made safe to walk on in seconds with a sprinkle of Bamboo Snow.

Sweep up the spill with a broom and dustpan. Could not be easier.
