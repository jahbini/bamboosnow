Raw, dry virgin Bamboo Snow is a perfect composter: you can control the rate of compost production simply by adjust its water content.

Add any organic material to bamboo snow, and it will dry out.  A layer of a half an inch of dry bamboo snow will lock odors inside.  That means your compost heap is invisible to ants, flies, roaches, rats, cats or dogs.

However, by adding a slight amount of water to the mixture, the bacterial processes proceed rapidly.  Just stir to aerate, and cover with a small amount of dry bamboo snow to lock in the odors and protect from unwanted insects.

No processing, not even sifting, is needed for this use.
