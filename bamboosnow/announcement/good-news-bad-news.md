### The Good News
I have discovered an abundant, ancient, but **overlooked** natural resource that can reduce water consumption worldwide. It is currently in the environment and has been well tolerated by humans for *millions* of years. It can be used daily by millions of people for personal comfort and cleanliness.  It also can be used in construction, agriculture and sanitation.

  <div class="siteInvitation"></div>
With an infinite shelf life, this commodity is easily and quickly produced wherever bamboo grows. Minimal processing is required to make finished products, merely sifting, mixing or sewing. *This means plantations and remote villages can add this revenue stream with __no __ capital investment.*
### The Bad News
<!-- more -->
It's bug poop.  From *Dinoderus Minutis* -- the dreaded Bamboo Borer beetle.

### The Job:
Create a worldwide market place for Bamboo Snow and raise the well-being of millions.

## Unicorn's Lament
I have never created a worldwide industry in an unknown commodity from a tiny tropic island in the vastness of the Deep Pacific Ocean, so if you can do it better, go ahead!

My plan is to simply publish my observations and encourage a legion of entrepreneurs to get involved with Bamboo Snow.
