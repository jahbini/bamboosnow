Ahsan Ul Karim Kanchon</p><p>Director</p><p>Bay Textile &amp; Fashions Ltd.</p><p>Ashan, I really appreciate our meeting in Dhaka.  I am sure that you and your team of wizards can make miracles happen.</p><p>So this is my vision of a miracle:</p><p>My job is two sided: Create some Bamboo Snow, and then make it available to the people who can put it to great use.</p><p>I think the following strategy makes this possible: Create a “go-fund-me” online campaign to raise money for production and deliver the products and raw materials after the end of the season.</p><p> The on-line campaign will promote the uses of Bamboo Snow, the benefits to the environment, the benefits to the producers in the remote villages.  People can fund the campaign at a Small Dollar level and get a bag with a 0.1 litre of Bamboo Snow, The next level up would be a sweatband or pillow mat.</p><p> Donators at a larger level would actually buy the bulk of the production of a ‘Unit” level.</p><p> The unit of production is a farmer in a village that will supply the bamboo and curing facility.  This works in a series of micro-payments:  We fund a stipend of (for example) $200 per month for the bamboo and rent of the remote facility.  We ask for periodic photo updates of the production to continue the payments to the farmer.</p><p> At the end of the season, we buy the bulk of the harvest at some agreed upon rate, and the payment would be in the range of $2k US for the shipment.</p><p> The funds to pay the farmer are already secured by the (hopeful) success of the on-line campaign.  The costs at that point are transportation costs to Dhaka or other shipping/manufacturing hub.</p><p> On the manufacturing side, we know exactly how many sweatbands, bags and pillow mats several months before delivery.  The units can be pre-made and ready for filling before the fall harvests.  They are already paid for, we just need to allocate sufficient monies to guarantee delivery and shipment.</p><p> In this scheme, your production facility would become the model for production: Islam seems like the exact person to make the production of high-quality Bamboo Snow reliable and abundant.</p><p> My part of this is to craft the “west facing” marketing and promotion to assure funding of the campaign.  Your part would be to make a regional campaign to get village based production units signed-up.  This campaign should be based on SMS and Web based communication to the small villages in the mountainous regions that product the most bamboo.  Your team was already familiar with the great system of micro-payment technology: &quot;bKash.&quot;</p><p> With a duplicatable campaign for the villagers, we should be able to create abundant supply all over S.E. Asia, Bangladesh and India.  The places that can benefit the most from the improvement in sanitation that Bamboo Snow can provide.</p><p> Jim Hinds</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-3"><div id="sidebarCap"><aside id="sidebar"></aside></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="outer"><div class="inner">© 2016 James A.
