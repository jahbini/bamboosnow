This vest is reversable one side reflects heat back to the body, and the other is better at absorbing the heat.  I use it under my shirt to get maximum performance.</p><p>When I’m not wearing it I let it air in the open, and never put it in a closed container.<br />It the surface gets soiled, I just mix a bit of cleaner with bamboo snow, and use a brush to clean.  Washing in the laundry is <strong>not</strong> recommended.</p><h2 id="production-notes">Production Notes</h2><p>alert@@This prototype vest allows the bamboo snow to move, and collect at the bottom.<br />An effective vest design must have means to keep bamboo snow immobile.</p><p>Note:  The cut of the prototype was modeled after wedding attire.  A simpler cut with the bamboo snow placed appropriately is needed.</p><p>The cloth for the prototype has a very fine weave and is effective to keep the bamboo snow inside the vest.</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div>
