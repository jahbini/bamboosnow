            p The productivity and well-being of any society depends on the health of the people. Public Sanitation is not just a human right, but is a necessary component for society.
            p Bamboo Snow tames any kind of organic waste by encasing it in an odor free hull, and dehydrating the waste. It turns the septic disaster of open defecation into a simple matter of covering the waste with dehydrating Bamboo Snow.
            p When the mixture is kept dry the Bamboo Snow maintains a sterile environment. When water is added it quickly and safely produces useful compost.
