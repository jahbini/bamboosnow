And most everything else.  Saipan, too.  I got run-down to the point that I left for La Paz, Mexico and spent three months there.  La Paz is nice.  Inexpensive.  Good vegetables, meats, and dairy.  Mostly western farming techniques, so there is that.  But, the vegetables look like jewels on the shelf.</p><p>The downside was that I had lost the tiny harvest of Bamboo Snow for the whole year.  The building only had one sweet spot that the insects loved, and even that was blown away at midnight.  I would have to use what little I had very sparingly until I could farm some more.</p><p> But La Paz was surprisingly cold, in spite of the words “Baja California” — It’s supposed to be warm, but no.  Still, the food was good, and I found that dabbing tincture of iodine under my arm pits seemed to help me endure the cold.  I never did go out to the Sea of Cortez, alas: My stay and life is funded by doing a bit of contract programming.  Wi-fi at sea is not possible, so I stay within sight of a cell-phone tower.  It’s my leash.</p><p>In La Paz there are beautiful statues along the beach:<span>A mermaid chasing a dolphin, </span><span>a giant pearl,</span> and outstanding over all else is <span>the old man in a paper boat.</span></p><p> But, my leash extends to many places in the world, and I wanted to check out the bamboo possibilities in South East Asia.  And Cambodia is the first choice: warm and no typhoons.  So I left La Paz to Saipan by way of Cambodia, Bangkok and Dhaka.</p><p> Cambodia’s main city Phnom Penh, sounds like something hanging from a two year old’s nose.  The reality is a busy, quirky place very much like Dhaka but with one tenth the population.  There is a major influx of capitol into the city, and prosperity seems like a glimmer on the horizon, but that prosperity will boost the population density to incredible proportions.  Will the filth of Dhaka be the future of Phnom Penh?</p><p> The tuktuk drivers are the main taxi service, and hailing one is simple easy all over the continent.  Just use the app on the cell phone and a driver shows up in seconds. Cambodia, Bangkok, Dhaka.  The drivers get a display of the route on their phone, but reading maps is not a skill they think they need.  If they point off in a new direction and smile, you may be in for an adventure.  Just point to their map. And growl.</p><p> There are “supermarkets” with European and World products.  Finding granola and Lindt chocolate and French cheeses was comforting to my tummy.  These western stores in Cambodia are at the base of security apartments designed for the huge number of west-o-crats it takes to build the buildings, infrastructure, and who knows what else the billionaires want to trickle down on Cambodia.</p><p> The people of Phnom Penh act a bit frozen if you send them anything out of their experience.  I’m told that a cultural shock from the Pol Pot era can last for two generations.</p><p> The best news about Cambodia is that the marketing effort to villagers to start production will be as easy as the internet.  Smart phone penetration in Cambodia and Thailand and even Bangladesh is way up.  </p><p> The best news about Bangkok is the incredible prosperity of the city.  Huge malls clustered together like fish-eggs but filled with upscale shoppers and car dealerships.  One older shopping plaza had rows of merchants selling guns, guns, guns. And worthy bookstores, too: I found a huge trove of Tarot Cards to replace the deck that Super Typhoon Yutu ate.  It took me an hour just to pick the right decks.  I got two half-sized Smith-Waite decks in little tin containers — That will help them survive the next super typhoon.</p><p> The subway in Bangkok is efficient, clean and awesome.  There are elevated trains that give great views of the city and show the contrast of the newer and older construction for miles around.  Very impressive.</p><p> I also went to Dhaka, Bangladesh for a business meeting about producing bamboo snow and finished sewn articles.  The craftsmanship there is incredible compared to some prototypes I had made in Mexico.</p><p> The trip from the airport to my meeting was slow.  It seems that there was a major protest about a drowning and thousands of people were just standing in the middle of major intersections.  That’s Dhaka.</p><p> Now I’m back on Saipan getting re-organized — a super challenge. The tourist industry is driven by Chinese and the big casino that sits in the middle of downtown Garapan. That has raised housing costs through the CNMI roof, and is nearly on par with US mainland cities.</p><p> But I think I have all the pieces now to put together a meaningful ‘go-fund-me' style campaign to raise money for initial production and distribution of Bamboo Snow.  A real deal, not just a dream.</p><p> But as I wake up and start to move ahead, I have one MAJOR problem.  I have run out of Bamboo Snow, and I need it to clean my dishes, and keep my hair shiny and my scalp clean.  I realize now just how effective this stuff is: I need it for daily personal care. The world needs it. </p><p>J</p><p>PS: judging from the amount of people and construction at the airports, it looks like commerce in the whole region is blasting sky-high.</p></div></div></div><footer class="card-footer"><p class="text-muted">that's all--</p></footer></div></div>
