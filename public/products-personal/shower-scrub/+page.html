Every part.  Yes, that too.</p><p>Bamboo Snow mixes with liquid shower soap to make a very effective face and body scrub.  It cleans away dead skin with ease and rinses thoroughly.</p><p>Conditioning skin oils can be mixed in as well.</p><p>Bamboo Snow helps the soap mobilize and remove dirt, grime and dead skin.  It actally is a soap magnifier, because it is applied directly to the surface, rather than diluted in water.</p><p>Bamboo Snow absorbs the grime inside each particle, and rinses away most easily.</p><p>You will be impressed.</p></div>
