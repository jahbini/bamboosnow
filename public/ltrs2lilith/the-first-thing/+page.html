<div id="bloviation" class="contents"><h4>The First Thing I did with Bamboo Snow:</h4><p>Was to make sure it was safe.  So I gave a bunch away as little bags to clean your cell phone or glasses.  Tap the bag on the surface to let the snow fall, wipe the snow away with the bag and the surface is clean. Bamboo Snow works great, and nobody ever even sneezed.</p><p>And if you took your sample of Bamboo Snow, even with the little mineral hardened bits, and put it in small muslin bags, you have a combination glass cleaner, popurri sachet, hand exerciser all in one.</p><p>Or, after you sift out the good from the big in that sample you have, you can use the big nuggets for The Bilge: in the pre-clumped state Bamboo Snow is extra good at desiccating the slough.  Or maybe for the cat box.  I know that cats don’t like the powdery texture of dry Bamboo Snow.  Nor mice or insects.</p><p>The fine powder is best for personal use.  I use bamboo snow everyday for cleaning, and while I don’t always have access to the best of the best, Bamboo Snow has never let me down yet.</p><p>It’s the Dust You Can Trust.</p>Jim<p>PS:  Lillith, I’m wanting to re-use these e-mails as a weekly mailing list thing or FB thing.  It’s like an introduction to bamboo snow, step by step.  What I’ve done with it, etc.  I’ll remove all personal references to your real identity.  OK?  Just be the muse.</p></div>
