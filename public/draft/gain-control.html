Too much happening and it’s all bad and out of control.  But what if …???What if you could take control of yourself and learn to handle the stressors. Ignore the things that are<img src="{{assets}}images/picture-of-jim.thumbnail.jpg" style="margin:1em; float: right; vertical-align: top" alt="Jim Hinds, Creator of The Celarien Experience®" />really just not that important to you.  Focus your energies on those really important things.  Be at peace with yourself and the people around you.What would your life be like?  You know it is possible – you probably know of a few people who never seem to have a bad day, and are competent and confidently serene in their successes.  We here would say these people have Celarien®.But you are probably asking “<span class="pullquote">What is The Celarien Experience®?</span>“Jim Hinds has received advanced hypnosis training and created The Celarien Experience®, which is a gestalt of the most advanced techniques of hypnosis, NLP, time-line imagery, energy therapy and suggestion. The Celarien Experience® allows you to go far beyond what most hypnotists can do in a hypnosis session. Here is a quick outline of how this highly focussed therapy will differ from all of the rest:<ul><li>You will receive a comprehensive “pre-talk” in which you will learn about hypnosis.</li><li>You will talk with Jim so that we will find out what your goals are, what might be blocking you from attaining them, and how best to help you to reach those goals using hypnotherapy and ongoing hypnosis or self-hypnosis.</li><li>Jim will use a modern and efficient hypnotic induction (no swinging watches or blinking eyeglasses are used). These techniques are fast and efficient allowing us to spend more time working with you to release your blocks and gain your goals.</li><li>Jim will ensure that you are going into just the right level of hypnosis for the kind of work you will be doing together. Once that has been accomplished he will provide you with some objective evidence that you were hypnotized.</li><li>Jim will customize each session for you. The Celarien Experience® matches the right inductions, deepening techniques, suggestions and other techniques to each client for maximum results.</li><li>Jim invented The Celarien Experience®. Your work with him will not be one of those one-shot deals. You will work together as a team as you go through the process, neutralizing any old limiting beliefs, emotions or habits that have caused you to not be as successful as you would like to be regarding the issues that you want to work on.</li><li>Jim will go beyond merely suggesting changes and the visualization techniques offered by so many which only bring about limited results. The essence of The Celarien Experience® is to find the actual cause of the problem and eliminate it, and then give you suggestions for success. This enables our clients to be very successful and experience long term and even permanent results.  You will always have continuing support that is just a phone call away.</li><li>We will able to deal with issues that could be causing problems that you may not have thought of such as internal conflicts. For example, most people who want to make positive changes in their lives also are a bit conflicted by making the changes, like the smoker who wants to stop but is fearful that he or she will miss the cigarette habit or gain weight. Another example is the person who has been abusing alcohol or drugs who fears that if he or she abstains they will be lonely or anxious without the alcohol or drug.  A non-drinker, non-smoker, non-drug user is not a victim and need not give up any control over him or her self.</li><li>Jim will take you through each phase of the process, customizing each phase for your needs, making sure that your hypnosis experience is completely professional, confidential and effective.We hope that this additional information about The Celarien Experience® has been useful for you. When you work with Jim you are working with one of the best trained hypnosis professionals in the world.</li></ul>If you have any further questions please contact our office.
