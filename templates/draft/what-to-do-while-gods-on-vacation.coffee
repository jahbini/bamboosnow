Then it hit me.  “WE” are in charge. “WE” need to preserve, protect, keep things in good working order.  For a life-force, of which we humans seem to be the current leaders, we want to insure the continued continuity, growth and harmony of life, and if we play our cards right, US.

If one particular person can get a vision of his bliss, clean up his values so that his emotional reactions and intellect are in harmony with that vision, mighty things can happen. That’s the basic premiss of Celarien.  Especially so if a nation or culture can do that.  Our challenge is that all of us reap the rewards, and all of us get more comfortable with the idea that “WE” are responsible for our collective future.  “WE” can create any future we want.  Let’s shoot for the higher good.
