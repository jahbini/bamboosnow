      T.p => T.raw "Famed researchers like Jay Haley or Milton Erickson have found that most of our emotional responses are learned, yes learned, as infants, children or in school.  Those emotions didn’t just get put there by magic, did they. So what if you could unlearn those emotional responses that just don’t work anymore? And learn new ones that fit your current life?  Would you like that or what?"
