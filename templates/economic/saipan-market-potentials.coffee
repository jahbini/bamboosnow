Advertisement to tourists, however, is a thriving business.
Common lines of communication like newspaper ads or US Mail are out.
Many people use English as amateurs.  Tourists and the elderly may not be able to handle more than &quot;good morning&quot;, and simple graphic images are more powerful.  Translation of marketing information may be required to reach non-english readers.  Good graphics and translation add to the expense of marketing any product.  Any product to a Saipan market

I’m told the Spanish used Saipan for range for the cattle, sheep or goats or whatever.
Camorros started coming back about the time of the Spanish-American war.  They are the largest native segment.  Mostly they have strong blood ties to the phillipines.  The Chamorros have lost 95% or more of their culture, no songs, dances, stories, only the language.  They did not even adapt the Spanish culture as the Philipinos had.  Just Roman Catholicism.

They came to Saipan in the late 1800’s because of bad weather back on the home islands.  The Spanish were tired of their Empire by then and could not mount enough force to clear Saipan again."
