      """
      T.p """And if you took your sample of Bamboo Snow, even with the little mineral hardened bits, and put it in small muslin bags, you have a combination glass cleaner, popurri sachet, hand exerciser all in one.
      """
      T.p """Or, after you sift out the good from the big in that sample you have, you can use the big nuggets for The Bilge: in the pre-clumped state Bamboo Snow is extra good at desiccating the slough.  Or maybe for the cat box.  I know that cats don’t like the powdery texture of dry Bamboo Snow.  Nor mice or insects.
      """
      T.p """The fine powder is best for personal use.  I use bamboo snow everyday for cleaning, and while I don’t always have access to the best of the best, Bamboo Snow has never let me down yet.
