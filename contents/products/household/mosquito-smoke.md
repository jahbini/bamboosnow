The weather on Saipan was hot and humid for three months.  Daytime temperatures
were 95+ and the nights were drenched in sweat.  And then the rains came, torrent
after torrent, but the humidity and temperature stayed way up.

And with the rain, came the mosquitoes.

_We_ had used Bamboo Snow to clear out mosquitoes after Typhoon Soudelar, so it was natural to turn to Bamboo Snow.

Now, instead of trying to get rid of the mosquitoes at night, I find that smudging my apartment during the day keeps mosquitoes away all night.  Bamboo Snow contains only natural cellulose from bamboo and NOTHING added.

The effect?  The mosquitoes have decided that my closets and apartment provide no shelter, and they have moved out.

## Thank You, Bamboo Snow
