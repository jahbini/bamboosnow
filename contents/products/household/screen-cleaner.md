This always amazes folks when I show it to them:

Place Bamboo Snow in a bag.  Simply tap the bag against the oily surface.  Wipe away the powder and the grease and dirt are gone.

This works on glass, plastic, TV and computer screens, windows and car surfaces.  A soft brush will wipe away any bamboo snow easily -- it wont cling to the surface.
