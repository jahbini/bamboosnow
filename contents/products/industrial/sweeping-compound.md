Bamboo Snow conquers slippery spills in seconds.

Raw, dry bamboo snow will suck up oil, grease or water from a floor in a moment.  A slippery floor can be made safe to walk on in seconds with a sprinkle of Bamboo Snow.

Sweep up the spill with a broom and dustpan. Could not be easier.

Bamboo Snow not only absorbs liquids, it holds in nasty odors.  Even a quarter inch of dry Bamboo Snow over the spot and odor is gone.
